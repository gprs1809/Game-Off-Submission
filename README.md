# Game-Off-Submission

This is my submission for Game Off 2023. The game (built using Unity) involves a player jumping across obstacles. The obstacles come before the player randomly and also the height of the obstacle varies with a certain range. The theme 'scale' is captured in both the player jumping and the change of height of the obstacles. This game is an enhancement over a game that was built in the Unity Junior programming pathway that I took up recently.
